                        A PCB Design is the process of creating the layout and electrical connections of a circuit on a flat board using conductive pathways, pads, and tracks made of copper.</h5>
                        <h5 style={{ color: '#ffffff', fontSize: '1rem', lineHeight: '1.9', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
                        These boards hold and connect electronic components such as resistors, capacitors, ICs (Integrated Circuits), sensors, and microcontrollers in a compact and organized way.</h5>
