                        ROS stands for Robot Operating System, which is an open-source framework designed to help in building, controlling, and managing robotic systems.
                        </h5>

                        <h5 style={{ color: '#ffffff', fontSize: '1rem', lineHeight: '1.9', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
                        It is not a real operating system like Windows or Linux, but a set of software tools, libraries, and programs that make robot development faster and easier.</h5>
                        <h5 style={{ color: '#ffffff', fontSize: '1rem', lineHeight: '1.9', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
                        ROS allows different parts of a robot such as sensors, motors, and controllers  to communicate and work together in a smooth, organized way.</h5>
                        <h5 style={{ color: '#ffffff', fontSize: '1rem', lineHeight: '1.9', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
                        It acts as the central brain of the robot, managing how data is shared and how the robot performs actions in real time.</h5>
                        <h5 style={{ color: '#ffffff', fontSize: '1rem', lineHeight: '1.9', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
                        Developers use ROS to perform advanced robotic functions like path planning, image processing, motion control, and mapping.</h5>
