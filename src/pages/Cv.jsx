                        <h5 style={{ color: '#ffffff', fontSize: '1rem', lineHeight: '1.9', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
                            Computer Vision (CV) is a specialized field of Artificial Intelligence that enables machines to interpret and understand visual information such as images, videos, and real-time camera feeds.
                            By replicating human visual perception, CV empowers systems to identify objects, recognize faces, read text, detect motion, and analyze patterns in visual data.
                            This technology drives numerous innovations—from autonomous vehicles and healthcare diagnostics to retail analytics, agriculture monitoring, and smart surveillance systems—making it one of the most powerful domains of modern AI.

                        </h5>

                        <h5 style={{ color: '#ffffff', fontSize: '1rem', lineHeight: '1.9', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
                            Computer Vision focuses on allowing machines to extract meaningful insights from visual inputs and make intelligent decisions based on them.
                            It combines image processing, pattern recognition, machine learning, and deep learning to convert raw pixel data into structured understanding.</h5>
