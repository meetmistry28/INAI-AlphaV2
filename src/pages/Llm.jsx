                        <h5 style={{ color: '#ffffff', fontSize: '1rem', lineHeight: '1.9', marginBottom: '15px' }}>
                            Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced artificial intelligence systems designed to understand, generate, and process human language at scale. They are trained on massive text datasets containing trillions of words from diverse sources such as books, websites, and articles. Using transformer-based deep learning architectures, these models capture intricate linguistic patterns, enabling them to perform various tasks — from answering questions and summarizing documents to writing code and conducting intelligent conversations.
                            LLMs represent a major leap in AI evolution due to their few-shot and zero-shot learning capabilities, allowing them to perform new tasks without extensive retraining. Popular examples include GPT, Claude, PaLM, and LLaMA, which power chatbots, virtual assistants, coding tools, and content creation platforms.

                            Natural Language Processing integrates linguistics, computer science, and machine learning to make sense of human language data. Unlike structured data, natural language is ambiguous, context-dependent, and complex—making NLP a challenging but vital part of AI.
                            NLP involves several stages of language understanding, including tokenization, parsing, semantic analysis, and contextual modeling.
                            With advancements in deep learning, especially through Transformer-based architectures, modern NLP systems can now understand nuances, tone, and intent with near-human accuracy.
